# Objektbuch
Objektbuch is a tiny C++ header-only library that provides the
`ObjectBook` class for identifying objects via an integer handle.
Its original use case is the safe reference of objects from the
Python to the C++ world using only integers via Ctypes.
Objektbuch can be wrapped as a subproject.
